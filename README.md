# Intuition
Intuition is a VST/AU/standalone digital synthesizer designed to combine high-performance digital signal processing with an intuitive, modular workflow for sound design and music production. 

## Overview
The project aims to provide musicians and producers with a flexible environment for creating and manipulating sound in real time, without sacrificing usability or creative flow. Unlike many existing synthesizers that trade performance for complexity or simplicity for control, Intuition seeks to bridge that gap. It offers a robust synthesis engine built in C++ using JUCE, capable of handling multiple oscillators, modulation sources, and signal routing options efficiently. The system architecture emphasizes modularity, allowing features such as wavetable synthesis, unison detuning, and morphing to be expanded and customized over time. Ultimately, Intuitionâ€™s goal is to empower users to explore advanced sound design techniques through a responsive, user-friendly interface that feels creative rather than technical.

## Features
### 4 Powerful Oscillator Modules
### Wavetable Morphing
### Advanced Modulation Routing
